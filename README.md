recirculating
=============

Prototype for 3D printable linear motion carriage with recirculating Delrin/Nylon balls, for use with OpenBeam.

recirc_bearing_2piece reduces the number of travel moves when printing the bearing track and makes it easier to inspect and clean the track 

recirc_plate is modified to move the preloading bolt(s) to the inside of the extrusion, leaving the outer side clear for cable runs
